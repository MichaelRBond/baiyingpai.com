                                <p>
                                    Many people live a life of quiet desperation. It is very unfortunate to see people walking around being tired, unfocused, stressed. They feel out of control. They are trapped in the hypnotic conditioning of their fears, doubts and worries. A typical day is spent going to work, dealing with the constant hassles of putting out fires for nine to ten hours per day, skipping meals, and rushing to get home to sit in front of the television and forget about the daily grind. Week after week this habit goes on. The weeks turn to months and the months to years. Over a period of time you become conditioned to believe, "Well, thatâ€™s just the way it is, thereâ€™s nothing I can do about it."" Helplessly you continue doing what youâ€™re doing, feeling as if just hanging in there is the answer.

To know that you are taking care of yourself in a way that allows you to have more energy and passion for the things that matter most in your life. Imagine the positive change you can make in the people around you. Your life has the potential to be a masterpiece.

                    <p class="lead">
                        At White Eagle Martial Arts we teach the art of Bai Ying Pai which means White Eagle System. It is an eclectic art form developed by Master William O. Cummings who has dedicated over 40 years of his life to the study of Martial Arts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Master Cummings has trained with many of the pioneers of martial arts including Masters Glenn Premru, Sam Pearson, Ted Volrath, John Hamilton, Tom Turcotte, Gene Thorner, Tony Farrell, and Roriko Masatani. Master Cummings became proficient at Kung-Fu and Karate along with Judo and Aikido and after many years of using these styles a natural blending occurred. This mass of knowledge included four different styles of Karate, three styles of Kung-Fu, plus Judo and Aikido leading to the development of a total system. Bai Ying Pai incorporates the hard, straight line, interceptive movement of Karate with the soft, flowing, re-directive movement of Kung-Fu, and combines these with the throws, falls, and grappling of Judo and the joint locking, and projections of Aikido.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After years of success at tournaments from Pennsylvania to Texas Master Cummings was encouraged by many of the above named Masters to develop his own system, which was recognized as an official style at the Okinawan Karate Federation meeting in Ontario Canada in March of 2002.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Although the style is relatively new, we maintain our traditional values and many traditional Katas from Shorin-Ryu, Pai-Lum, Hung-gar, and Wai-Lum. Master Cummings has found many parallels between his system and Jeet Kune Do (JKD) developed by Bruce Lee.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        White Eagle's traditional teaching produces disciplined, confident students who have learned how to set and achieve goals, earn respect and accept responsibility. We welcome people of all ages to become part of the Martial Arts tradition of achievement through hard work.

                                <p>Master William O. Cummings, who is known as Sensei by thousands of people in the Morgantown area, has been teaching Martial Arts in Morgantown since 1980 and started studying martial arts in the early 1960â€™s.</p>

                                <p>"I have been fortunate enough to get to study with many of the best Martial Artists available like Glenn Premru, Sam Pearson, Daniel Pai, John Hamilton, Tom Turcotte, Ted Volrath, Gene Thorner, Roriko Masatani, â€˜Xiomin Jin, Toni Farrell. What a wonderful education in Martial Arts â€˜I received from this diverse group. With over 40 years dedicated to â€˜ the study of the Martial Arts I was able to blend Karate, Kung-Fu, Judo, and Aikido into one of the most comprehensive systems to be found, one that was internationally recognized by the Okinawan Karate Federation. I have found that I have come to many of the same conclusions as Miyamoto Musashi, "You must study the ways of all professions to learn the true way," and by Bruce Lee who also developed his own system from the study of many. I pride myself in keeping the old traditions alive while taking advantage of modern equipment at the same time. I still look at Martial Arts Training as the tool we use for self improvement; confident people with active minds, good self esteem who have learned how to achieve goals through hard work and perseverance develop leaders that you can be proud of."</p>

                                <p>"At White Eagle we have a written curriculum, experienced instructors a top of the line facility. Rank is not given freely, it is earned, thatâ€™s why our proud group of students holds their heads up high when they say "I am what I am because I choose to be. I am an Eagle by choice â€¦"</p>

                                <p>Sue Hartzell, White Eagleâ€™s most dedicated student, started at White Eagle in the early 80â€™s. She already had a Brown Belt in another system, but Sue obviously liked what she found at White Eagle, since she continues with us over 25 years later.</p>

                                <p>Sue was part of an early SIT class (student instructor training) that put us on the map. Her class traveled all over the country loading-up on trophies. Over the next three years, Sue placed in the top three in every event she entered, including a first and a third at the Okinawan Karate Federation international tournament in Corpis Christy, TX. Sue is known for her un-canny ability to remember Kata (pre-determinded sets of techniques passed down for hundreds of years). She keeps about 40 of them in her head and thus has the title of chief kata resource for the school.</p>

                                <p>She is a well rounded Martial Artist with individual Black Belts in Shorin-Ryu Karate, Pai-Lum Kung Fu, Judo, and Aikido and Master rank in Bai Ying Pai. Her first love is probably Aikido and many audiences have been dazzled by her expertise as multiple attackers go flying everywhere during demos. During the day, Sue is a Physical Therapy Assistant at Health Works.</p>

                                <p>Mike has been with White Eagle Martial Arts since 2005. Mike knows how to put the emphasis on "work in and work out." Mike has always taken instruction the way it should be. If you point something out that needs worked on in class, he takes action and has it corrected by the next class. Mike realizes that you get what you put in and gives 110% all the time. Mikeâ€™s teaching method is to lead by example, and it is a good example at that. By the way â€¦ in his quest for perfection in Martial Arts, he has lost more than 100 pounds!</p>

                                <p>During the day Mike is a Software Engineer at Move, Inc. When Mike is not flying through the air at White Eagle Demos, you may find him flying with the help of wings. He has his pilot's license!</p>
